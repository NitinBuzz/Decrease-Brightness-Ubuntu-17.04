Decrease or Increase Brightness of Laptop Screen in Ubuntu

Do you want to decrease/increase the brightness of your Ubuntu laptop screen but brightness settings aren't working ? No Probelms - Here's the solution.

Open the Terminal and follow up these commands-

      cd /sys/class/backlight/nv_backlight
      sudo subl brightness 
      
In that file, you can find percentage of brightness that's set in your laptop. Go modify it to set it up or down & do save the file before closin' it.

#Cheers
